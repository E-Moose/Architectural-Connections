								<h3><font color = "2E3842">British Columbia Institute of Technology | BCIT</font></h3>
								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">The British Columbia Institute of Technology is one of British Columbia's largest post-secondary institutions, with more than 48,000 students. BCIT offers degrees, diplomas and certificates spanning Applied and Natural Sciences, Business and Media, Computing and Information Technology, Engineering, Health Sciences and Trades. </p>

								<p>At BCIT, students learn theory and put it into practice all in one process. Students learn from industry-based faculty, and graduate with industry-recognized credentials. BCIT works with industry to ensure that education remains on the cutting edge of current practices, and engages students in the classroom, in the lab, and in the field, building a broad and relevant spectrum of skills.</p>
								<p>BCIT offers a full-time two-year <font color = "2E3842"><b>Architectural and Building Technology Diploma</b></font>, with the option for student to continue studying for two more years to achieve an <font color = "2E3842"><b>Architectural Science</b></font> Bachelor's Degree.</font></p>

								<h3><font color = "2E3842">Architectural and Building Technology | ABT</font></h3>
								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">Architectural and Building Technology is a rigorous two-year diploma program combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills and technical training to prepare for jobs in design, development, construction, and building science. Students take courses in construction drawing, materials and methods, estimating techniques, building systems, and computer applications. In addition to the core courses, students can choose electives in second year in one of three streams: Architectural, Building Science and Economics/Construction Operations. The Architectural and Building Technology diploma is a prerequisite for the Architectural Science degree.</font></p>

								<h3><font color = "2E3842">Architectural Science | ARSC</font></h3>
								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">The Bachelor in Architectural Science is a full-time, four-year program (two years in addition to the Architectural and Building Technology Diploma or equivalent program at another post-secondary school) that uses the technical skills taught in the diploma as a basis to launch into a broader exploration of architecture and design. With an emphasis on the design process, the program is a bridge between pure design theory and construction practice. Courses are focused on design studios, but also include graphic and presentation skills, building history, sustainability, building science, management and liberal studies. There are also opportunities for students to go on an exchange to Germany or Italy in their third year for the second semester. The program also enables students to pursue further educational opportunities towards professional designation.</p>

								<p>The purpose of Architectural Science is to blow your mind, in a way that is more engaging and more challenging than you thought was possible, so that you have the skills to add value to society on graduation.</font></p>

								<h3><font color = "2E3842">BCIT Student Association | BCITSA</font></h3>
								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">The BCITSA is a non-profit student services and advocacy organization for the BCIT. Their goal is to unite the students of today into a strong community while providing them with the best possible services to aid them in their success. Architectural Connections and BCITSA are constantly working together to make future events like design competitions and industry mixers possible. Our goals align and we thank them for the effort they put in for everyone.</font></p>

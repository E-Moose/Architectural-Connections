								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">Our club will benefit student life by giving the architectural students a voice in the student association and giving all students access to an architecturally minded club at BCIT. The club will host events for industry that will give opportunities to students for networking and future employment. The club, with its sense of unity, will keep in contact with past graduated members to help inform current members of the job placement opportunities that are available. The clubs main purpose will be to connect students together and give representation for the architectural students as a whole.</font></p>
								<hr />

								<h3><font color = "2E3842">Sustainability</font></h3>
								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">To ensure longevity at BCIT, the club will be a mandatory accessory to the Architectural Science Degree students in their third and fourth year and will be open to the Architectural and Building Technology Diploma students if they are interested in the architectural profession. Democratic elections for all positions will be run annually to ensure fairness of the club. Faculty will be encouraged to be involved to help pass the mandates from year to year. As well as alumni of the program and thus will be encouraged to keep in contact with the club to help inform new members of the benefits of this student run organization.</p>

								<p><font color = "9a9a9b">Our club will benefit student life by giving the architectural students a voice in the student association and giving all students access to an architecturally minded club at BCIT. The club will host events for industry that will give opportunities to students for networking and future employment. The club, with its sense of unity, will keep in contact with past graduated members to help inform current members of the job placement opportunities that are available. The clubs main purpose will be to connect students together and give representation for the architectural students as a whole.</font></p>
